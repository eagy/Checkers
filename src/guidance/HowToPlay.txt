Abbot Java GUI Testing Framework
1. The tool was developed by Timothy Wall. The tool is free to use, and can be downloaded from Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/abbot/). 
2. Abbot is a tool which facilitates the testing of GUI components using Java code. It is used to automate GUI interactions which would usually require human input. Human’s make errors, so automating the input for a GUI makes for more consistent testing. 
3. Abbot only supports Java.
4. This tool is designed specifically to unit test GUI’s. So it’s useful whenever you’re doing that. 
5. To use the tool you need to:
a. Download the tool and follow the install instructions found on the Abbot webpage (http://abbot.sourceforge.net/doc/quick-start.shtml).
b. To utilize abbot you use the Abbot Recorders ,while running your GUI, to capture user events for later playback. You can then use the Costello script editor to customize the scripts which are generated by Abbot. Finally, you can insert tests into these scripts and run them through Junit using the ScriptTestCase class. 
6. The limitation of this tool is that it is a bit of work, and it’s not particularly intuitive.  The additional work is merited if you’re testing a large code base, and you need to reliably reproduce the tests in the future.
